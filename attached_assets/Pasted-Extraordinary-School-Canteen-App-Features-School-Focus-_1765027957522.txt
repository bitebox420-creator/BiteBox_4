Extraordinary School Canteen App Features (School Focus)
These features ensure the app serves the unique needs of students, staff, and parents within an educational setting.

1. 👨‍👩‍👧 Parent-Child & Health Safety
Mandatory Allergen Profile: Parents must input their child’s confirmed allergies (e.g., dairy, peanuts, gluten) into the student profile. This profile blocks the purchase of non-compliant meals.

Default "No Thanks" Option: Parents can set a default "No Thanks" option for days when the child brings a packed lunch, preventing accidental pre-orders.

Nutritional Goal Tracking: Tracks the student's meal choices over the week/month and provides a summary to the parent (e.g., "75% fruits/vegetables," "Average 550 calories per lunch").

Parental Approval System: For younger students, parents can select a daily/weekly menu and require the student to only choose from the pre-approved list.

School Nurse Integration: The school nurse can flag specific dietary needs or restrictions on a student's profile that override parent settings, ensuring medical compliance.

2. 📚 Classroom & Academic Integration
Class Group Ordering: Teachers or staff can place a single bulk order for the entire class (e.g., for a field trip or classroom party).

Staggered Pickup Times: Orders are automatically grouped by Class/Grade Level and assigned specific, staggered collection times to prevent overcrowding in the canteen during short breaks.

Attendance Check: Integration with the school's attendance system (MIS) to automatically cancel or flag pre-orders for students marked absent that day.

"Brain Food" Tag: Meals or snacks scientifically linked to improved concentration or energy are specially flagged to encourage choices that support learning.

3. 💳 Dedicated School Account & Payment
Subsidy Management (Discreet): Manages Free and Reduced-Price Lunch programs entirely within the app. Staff KDS screens simply display "Prepaid" or "Student Account" to maintain student privacy.

Low-Balance Notification: Automated alerts sent to the parent when the student's canteen account balance drops below a set amount (e.g., the cost of two meals).

Spending Category Controls: Parents can restrict spending to specific categories (e.g., Meals Only, no snacks or drinks).

4. 📢 Staff & Administration Tools
Emergency Meal Provision: A quick system for staff to issue a standard, safe emergency meal to a student whose account is empty or who forgot their lunch.

Canteen Feedback Portal: A private channel for teachers and administrators to submit feedback on meal quality, service speed, or student satisfaction.

Menu Voting/Preference: Students and staff can vote on potential new menu items, giving them a voice and increasing engagement with the canteen.
