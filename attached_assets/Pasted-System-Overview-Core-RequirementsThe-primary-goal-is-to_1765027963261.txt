System Overview & Core RequirementsThe primary goal is to create a backend process (ideally a serverless function or API endpoint) that executes two sequential actions when a customer confirms an order:Data Persistence: Store the complete order details in the designated Supabase table.Admin Notification: Send a detailed order summary email to the vendor/administrator (you) using Formspree.II.

Supabase Data Persistence (orders Table)A table named orders must be created and securely populated.A. Required SchemaColumn NameData TypeConstraint/Notesorder_idUUID / TEXTPrimary Key. Must be unique for tracking.customer_nameTEXTFull name from the checkout form.customer_emailTEXTCustomer's contact email.customer_phoneTEXTCustomer's phone number.delivery_addressTEXTFull, structured delivery address (include street, city, pin code).order_itemsJSONBArray of objects: [{ item_id: X, name: 'Item A', qty: 2, unit_price: 150 }]subtotalNUMERICSum of item prices.delivery_feeNUMERICShipping/Delivery charge.total_amountNUMERICFinal amount charged.payment_methodTEXTe.g., "Cash on Delivery", "Online Payment (UPI/Card)".order_statusTEXTDefault to "Pending Vendor Confirmation".created_atTIMESTAMPZAuto-set upon insertion.B. Security NoteEnsure that the Supabase insertion is handled securely (e.g., using a service role key or Row Level Security (RLS) policies that only allow the authenticated backend function to write data), and not directly exposed to the public frontend using the Anon key for writing.IV. Formspree Admin Email NotificationThe Formspree endpoint must receive a POST request with structured data to generate a detailed email to the vendor.A. Email Subject & RecipientForm FieldValueNotes_subject🔥 New Order Alert: Order #[order_id]Must dynamically include the unique order ID.email[Vendor's Email Address]This is the recipient email where the notification must be sent.B. Detailed Email Body (message Field)The content mapped to the message field must be highly readable and structured (using HTML/Markdown if supported by Formspree, or clear plaintext formatting).Content Checklist:Order Header: Order ID and Order Placement Time (created_at).Customer & Delivery Details:Customer NameContact Phone NumberDelivery Address (formatted clearly)Order Summary Table:Must list each item with: Name, Quantity, Unit Price, Total Price (per item).Billing Summary (Bottom Line):SubtotalDelivery FeePayment MethodFINAL TOTAL AMOUNT (BOLD and Highlighted)Link: A direct link to the order detail page in your admin dashboard (if one exists).V. UI/UX and Frontend RequirementsThe entire order-to-confirmation flow (cart, checkout page, successful order confirmation screen) must adhere to the visual language of the specified reference applications.A. Design ReferencesZomato / Swiggy (https://www.zomato.com/ncr, https://www.swiggy.com/):Goal: Use these as inspiration for the Visual Hierarchy, Color Palette (focus on a single primary accent color like Zomato's red or Swiggy's orange/pink), and Mobile Responsiveness.Focus Areas: Clean item cards, prominent pricing, smooth transitions, and intuitive cart management.Your App (https://pbl-final1.netlify.app/):Goal: The UI/UX of the order flow and confirmation screens must be visually consistent with the existing aesthetic of this application. Match the font choices, padding, button styles, and overall brand identity.B. Order Confirmation ScreenAfter the order is successfully processed by the backend (Supabase insertion and Formspree email initiated), the customer should be redirected to a dedicated "Order Successful" page that:Displays a large, clear confirmation message (e.g., "Order Placed Successfully!").Shows the Order ID prominently.Provides an estimated delivery time/date.Matches the sleek, professional UI/UX of the reference apps.
